## üìö React Concepts Used

This project makes use of several key React fundamentals, including:

1. **React Hooks**:
   - `useState` for state management within functional components.
   - `useEffect` for side effects, such as fetching data from APIs and updating the component lifecycle.
   - `useContext` for global state management.
  
2. **React Router**:
   - Dynamic routing to manage page navigation efficiently.
   - `useParams` to access dynamic route parameters for individual product details.
   - `useLoaderData` for data preloading in certain routes.
  
3. **Conditional Rendering**:
   - Displaying content dynamically based on conditions, such as product availability and user authentication status.
  
4. **Component Reusability**:
   - Breaking down the user interface into reusable and maintainable components, such as `ProductCard`, `WishlistButton`, and `CartButton`.
  
5. **Event Handling**:
   - Managing user interactions, like adding products to the cart or wishlist, through event handlers.

## üîç Data Handling & Management

- **Context API**: Used for managing global state across the application, such as user authentication status and product details.
- **Local Storage**: Utilized for storing and persisting data like cart and wishlist items, ensuring the data remains available even after a page refresh.
